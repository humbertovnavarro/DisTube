# How to get cookies

- Click on the extension icon and click "Export".
- Copy the content of the exported file and paste it into your code.

```js
const { DisTube } = require("distube");

const distube = new DisTube({
  "...",
  youtubeCookie: [
    {
      domain: ".youtube.com",
      expirationDate: 1234567890,
      hostOnly: false,
      httpOnly: true,
      name: "LOGIN_INFO",
      path: "/",
      sameSite: "no_restriction",
      secure: true,
      session: false,
      value: "---xxx---",
    },
    "...",
  ],
});
```

- Or you can paste it into a file and use `fs.readFileSync` to read it.

```js
const { DisTube } = require("distube");
const fs = require("fs");

const distube = new DisTube({
  "...",
  youtubeCookie: JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("cookies.json")),
});
```
